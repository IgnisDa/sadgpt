# SadGPT

What if ChatGPT were sad? What if it was always crying and being a generally
upsetting person to be around?

## Built With

- [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/) - Used for building the UI
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Used for styling
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Web Hosting

## Why?

Just because. I wanted to learn some of the technologies I mentioned above and
figured I should make yet another shit-posting app.

## Contributing

You need to have some dependencies installed to get the server up and running. I
am too lazy to list them here, so consult the [`Dockerfile`](.devcontainer/Dockerfile)
to see what they are.

If you want superpowers, then install [mprocs](https://github.com/pvolok/mprocs),
run `mprocs` and access the application at http://localhost:3000. If you do not
want to, I'm sure you can look at [`mprocs.yml`](./mprocs.yml) to figure out how
to get it working :tm:.

## Acknowledgements

The project was inspired from somewhere. Visit the website to learn more. But
thanks to all those people whose stuff I have used.
